# Zero-Knowledge University Assignments

My coding assignments as a part of Harmony's ["Zero-Knowledge University"](https://www.harmonyzku.one/), a 9-week practical course on working with zero-knowledge proof cryptography, covering:

- An overview of zero-knowledge proof systems (Groth16 vs PLONK, SNARKs vs STARKs);
- Designing and evaluating zero-knowledge proof protocols;
- Writing Circom circuits for zero-knowledge proof applications;
- Using zero-knowledge proofs in blockchain infrastructure and application contexts.

In addition to weekly assignments, I also built an application utilizing zero-knowledge proofs as part of a final project that can be found [here](https://github.com/CDDelta/battleship3).
